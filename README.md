# ML-Tutorial
Basics of ML to Help Beginners made in Jupyter Notebook

## Welcome

Well, this is a tutorial series that will be covering all concepts discussed by Andrew NG in his course but in *Python* rather than the somewhat outdated and pretty mcuh no one uses it anyways practically. 

## Prerequisites
