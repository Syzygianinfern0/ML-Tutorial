# ML-Tutorial
Basics of ML to Help Beginners made in Jupyter Notebook

## Welcome

Well, this is a tutorial series that will be covering all concepts discussed by Andrew NG in his course but in *Python* rather than the somewhat outdated and pretty-mcuh-no-one-uses-it-anyways-practically Octave/Matlab. 

## Prerequisites

It's highly recommended that you achieve good comfort with python and learn numpy, matplotlib and pandas before starting.

Check out my tutorials for the same:

* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/Syzygianinfern0/Matplotlib-Tutorial)
